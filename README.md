# Ezpoison
1.12.1 addon that adds slash command for cleansing Poison Charge

/ezpoison
can be added at the start of any macro you spam while playing. Will use anti-venom then elixir of poison resistance if you have poison charge on you (AND ONLY POISON CHARGE, NO OTHER POISON DEBUFF)

example: macro
/ezpoison
/cast Shadow Bolt

You use it all the time, it will always use shadow bolt except when you have poison charge debuff, then it will use anti venom. If that's on cd (or ran out) it'll use elixir of poison resistance. If that runs out too it'll send you a whisper telling you you ran out of cleanses to lament on how dumb and underprepared you were.
